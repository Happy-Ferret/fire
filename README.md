# fire
Fire is a compositing window manager written from scratch. For now it's not portable(there are some hard-coded paths), but it can be easily modified to work on any system with opengl 4 compliance. In the future there will also be a OpenGL 3 version, but it is still not ready(the opengl33 branch).
